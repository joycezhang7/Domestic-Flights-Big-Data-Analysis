# Domestic-Flights-Big-Data-Analysis

This project deals with 6m records of domestic flights data in 2015. We utilized AWS Spark to import and analyze the delays of these flights. Then we compared the performance of each airline and performed cost-benefit analysis of the delays. 

This project contains two files: EDA for data visualization and transformation; PySpark code for running spark quries to compute.
